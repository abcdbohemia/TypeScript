/*
 * SingleTodo Component State Management: 'edit' and 'editTodo'
 *
 * This component manages the editable state of a single todo item.
 *
 * 1. State Variables:
 * - `edit`: A boolean state (`true` or `false`) that controls whether the todo item
 * is currently in "edit mode" (showing an input field) or "display mode"
 * (showing the text).
 * - Initial state: `useState(false)` means it starts in display mode.
 * - `editTodo`: A string state that holds the current text being edited in the input field.
 * It's initialized with the original `todo.todo` text.
 *
 * 2. How the 'edit' State Changes (Entering Edit Mode):
 * - The `edit` state changes from `false` to `true` when the **Edit icon** is clicked.
 * - The `onClick` handler for the Edit icon contains an `if` condition:
 * `if (!edit && !todo.isDone)`
 *
 * Let's break down this condition:
 * - `!edit`: This checks if the component is **NOT** currently in edit mode. (same as checking does edit= false)
 * - we are saying that the opposite of edit is true
 * - ! (logical NOT) operator does NOT affect the actual state of the variable it's applied to. 
 * - If `edit` is `false` (not editing), then `!edit` evaluates to `true`.
 * - If `edit` is `true` (already editing), then `!edit` evaluates to `false`.
 * This ensures you can only *enter* edit mode if you're not already in it.
 * - `!todo.isDone`: This checks if the todo item is **NOT** marked as done. (same as checking does todo.isDone = false)
 * (Typically, you wouldn't edit a completed todo).
 *
 * - If both conditions are `true` (i.e., `!edit` is `true` AND `!todo.isDone` is `true`):
 * - The line `setEdit(!edit);` is executed.
 * - Since `edit` was `false` at that moment, `!edit` evaluates to `true`.
 * - So, `setEdit(true)` is called. This is the action that updates the `edit` state
 * variable from `false` to `true`.
 * - React then re-renders the component.
 *
 * 3. How the UI Reacts to the 'edit' State (Conditional Rendering):
 * - The JSX uses a ternary operator to decide what to render:
 * `{edit ? ( <input ... /> ) : ( ... display text ... )}`
 *
 * - This reads as: "Is the `edit` state variable `true`?"
 * - **If `edit` is `true`:** The `<input>` field is rendered, allowing the user to edit `editTodo`.
 * This happens *after* the first click on the Edit icon.
 * - **If `edit` is `false`:** The code proceeds to the next part, which checks `todo.isDone`
 * to render either `<s>` (strikethrough) or `<span>` (normal text).
 * This is the initial display, and what's shown if you exit edit mode.
 *
 * 4. Summary of Flow:
 * - **Initial Load:** `edit` is `false`. UI shows plain text.
 * - **First Click on Edit Icon:** `edit` is `false`, so `!edit` is `true`. Condition passes.
 * `setEdit(!edit)` makes `edit` become `true`. UI re-renders, now showing input.
 * - **Subsequent Clicks on Edit Icon (while in edit mode):** `edit` is `true`, so `!edit` is `false`.
 * Condition fails. `setEdit(!edit)` is NOT called. UI remains in edit mode.
 * (To exit edit mode, you would typically add a "Save" or "Cancel" button that calls `setEdit(false)`).
